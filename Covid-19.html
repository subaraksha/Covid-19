      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.This variant was first discovered in Wuhan, China.The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear,Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market,it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market.However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections. </p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases.Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021. As this situation was completely new, people started panic buying and accumalation of products to escape from shortages.But, this affected the needy people.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">During the end of september, the death rate was considerably high which was around 1200. It has been found that the deaths occured due to the lack of ventilators and beds in hospitals. But in comparison with the second wave, the death rate was low. Inspite of dealing the situation without vaccine, deaths were less and active cases weren't as high as that of the second wave. Fear of death was observed in every home and it affected the mental health of the people. People lost their jobs and suffered to meet their needs. But, the govt supported in all aspects.  </p>

They have since been joined by the Sputnik V (manufactured under license by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, with additional production from Serum Inst.)</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">The delta variant of SARS CoV-2 is a highly transmissible variant of coronavirus that has become the most common variant worldwide.The delta variant was first detected in India in October 2020, meaning it arose before vaccination began. It was one of the causes of a second wave of infections in India early in 2021, and by April was the most common variant in that country.Delta is continuing to mutate and give rise to numerous new lineages.Studies state that, Delta is at least 50 per cent more transmissible than the alpha. By observing the impact of it in various contries, Indian researchers concluded its threat.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">Like several parts of the world, especially Europe, India has been experiencing a massive surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. As of April 10, 2021, India is the 3rd leading country based on the USA and Brazil's identified cases. Since the middle of March 2021, the second wave has started, and on April 09, the highest number of cases (144,829) has been identified in India. The major affected states are Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. </p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">The death rate was very high in the second wave in comparison with the first. An acute shortage of ventilators were observed as so many people suffered from respiratory issues. Though the number of ventilators were increased, patients increased times higher than the availability. The spread of the delta varient was so high that the hospitals weren't enough to treat the patients.Gastro-intestinal symptoms were also found and added complexity to the existing condition.Younger population were also terribly affected. </p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">India had started a mass vaccination program. As of May 4, 2021, about 29.1 million people, or 2.1% of the total population, were fully vaccinated.India had so far given 1581 million doses, and over 8% of the population has received one dose.The maximum vaccine usage was recorded during mid-April 2021. Afterward, the dose administered curve started to decrease from April end to early May 2021, which indicated the acute vaccine shortage. The government has also halted the export of vaccines to reduce the scarcity of Covishield. However, the covid workers were given the priority and most of them were fully vaccinated before the shortage of vaccines. The vaccination was given only for adults. </p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">India detected its first Omicron case on December 2 in Karnataka and till now, the country has logged more than a hundred cases of this virus. Before it was reported in India, Omicron cases had been found in 29 countries. The new variant of COVID-19 was first reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) from South Africa on November 25.The WHO has classified Omicron as a 'variant of concern'. The number of active cases and the test centres are increasing rapidly. The safety measures taken by the people is also declining considerably. </p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">The highly transmissible Omicron variant begins to overtake Delta virus, increasing the number of active cases in India. The spread is even more due to the absence of lockdown unlike 1st and 2nd wave.The active cases has crossed 3 Lakhs per day. States like Maharashtra,Kerela,Tamil Nadu,Karnataka has encountered more number of active cases due to the dense population of the state. </p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">Though the active cases are increasing rapidly, the death rate is low compared to that of the 2nd wave. The side effects on people is considerably low and no respiratory issues are found during the 3rd wave. The state data showed that in the three weeks between December 27 to Jan 16, when cases raced past 5.5 Lakhs, confirmed deaths were 314 only. So the threat to life is much lesser than other waves. But, this factor induces carelessness in people.</p>

      <img src="C:\Users\SUBARAKSHA\Desktop\VBC\3rd v.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"><br>
      <p style="font-size:17px;text-align:justify">By analysing the present condition of Covid, It has been announced that boaster doses of vaccines must be taken by the people. Also, children from 15-18 years are also eligible for vaccination. Unlike the shortage of medicines and vaccines in the previous waves, the government ruled out such issues in the 3rd wave. The percentage of fully vaccinated population has increased considerably which prevents the death rate. We can conclude from the available sources that Omicron is not a deadly virus and the situation can be dealt with a normal treatment.However, one must stay safe to prevent the spread of this viral disease and to save Earth. </p>
